Subject: [PATCH 4/7] dt-binding: riscv: add T-HEAD CPU reset

The secondary CPUs in T-HEAD SMP capable platforms need some special
handling. The first one is to write the warm reset entry to entry
register. The second one is write a SoC specific control value to
a SoC specific control reg. The last one is to clone some CSRs for
secondary CPUs to ensure these CSRs' values are the same as the
main boot CPU. This DT node is mainly used by opensbi firmware.
