Subject: [PATCH 04/24] checkpatch: Warn on page table access without accessors

Architectures may have special rules for accessing the hardware page
tables (for example, atomicity/ordering requirements), so the generic MM
code provides the pXXp_get() and set_pXX() hooks for architectures to
implement. These accessor functions are often omitted where a raw
pointer dereference is believed to be safe (i.e. race-free). However,
RISC-V needs to use these hooks to rewrite the page table values at
read/write time on some platforms. A raw pointer dereference will no
longer produce the correct value on those platforms, so the generic code
must always use the accessor functions.

sparse can only report improper pointer dereferences if every page table
pointer (variable, function argument, struct member) is individually
marked with an attribute (similar to __user). So while this is possible,
it would require invasive changes across all architectures. Instead, as
an immediate first solution, add a checkpatch warning that will
generally catch the prohibited pointer dereferences. Architecture code
is ignored, as the raw dereferences may be safe on some architectures.
